## LinkedIn Post (Personal Story Version)

```
Built something for job seekers with bad memory like me 😅

Ever applied to a job and THEN remembered "wait, I know someone there!"?

You know that friend who's always saying "bro, you should've asked me, I could've referred you easily"?

Well, now you can finally say: "Give me all the companies where you can refer me."

Just upload a simple CSV with names & companies, and **Referral Bro** will show you a badge next to every job listing where you have a connection.

✨ **Bonus:** It has a built-in AI prompt to convert any format to CSV, plus a Quick Add button to add contacts directly!

Works on:
• LinkedIn
• Indeed  
• Glassdoor
• Naukri

Would love your feedback! Link in comments 👇

🧵 Why I built Referral Bro:

1/ Ever applied to a job and THEN remembered you know someone at that company? Same. Every. Single. Time.

2/ Referred candidates are 4x more likely to get hired. But who can remember 200+ connections while scrolling through job listings?

3/ So I built a Chrome extension that solves this.

Import a CSV with your contacts → Browse job boards → See "💬 Refer Bro" badges next to companies where you know someone.

4/ It works on LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Naukri.

5/ Try it out: [link]
