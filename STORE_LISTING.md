## Detailed Description

### 🎯 Stop Applying Cold When You Have Warm Connections

**Referral candidates are 4x more likely to be hired.** But when you're applying to 20 jobs a day, who can remember which friend works where?

**Referral Bro** fixes that. It shows you exactly who you know at each company—right on the job listing.

### ✨ How It Works

1. **Import Your Network** — Upload a simple CSV with your contacts
2. **Browse Jobs** — Visit LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, or Naukri
3. **See Connections** — A badge appears next to companies where you know someone
4. **Reach Out** — Click to see names and copy them instantly

### 🚀 Key Features

📂 **Easy Import** — CSV or JSON format. Use our AI prompt to convert any list!
➕ **Quick Add** — Add contacts directly from the popup
📤 **Export** — Download your network as CSV anytime
🔍 **Smart Detection** — Automatically finds company names on job pages
💬 **Visual Badges** — "1 Refer Bro" or "3 Refer Bros" next to matched companies
📋 **One-Click Copy** — Copy contact names to reach out fast
⚡ **Lightning Fast** — Zero lag, works offline
