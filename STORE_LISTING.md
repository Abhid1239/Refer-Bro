That's it! No complex setup, no account creation, no subscriptions.

- Works best when you add multiple companies per contact

### 🤔 Why Referral Bro?

Studies show that **referred candidates are 4x more likely to be hired**. But during a job search, it's easy to forget who you know at each company. Referral Bro solves this by putting your network front and center, exactly when you need it.
